What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initialising a repository creates an empty repository which is tracked by git. This is essential in order for git to track your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area sits right between working directory and repository. It allows you flexibility to add only few files to commit rather than all of the files in one commit.
